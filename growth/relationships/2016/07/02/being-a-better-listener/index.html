    <p>Today, I was listening to the latest episode of <a href="http://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/">Still Untitled</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/donttrythis">Adam Savage</a> was talking about the smartest people he knows, and what he said was that they all frequently say the words “I don’t know”…</p>

<p>I thought that was interesting because it reminded me that I don’t tend to ask many questions when talking with others. And in fact, I actually tend to answer questions that were not asked. I spend most of a conversation looking for some connection to something I have recently learned so that I can share it with everyone else. I have typically thought of this as normal, but it is not.</p>

<p>In fact, I think this is why most people think that I am a know it all. In truth I don’t think i know everything and in most cases I am ready to learn so that I can be a more informed individual. It occurred to me that at the heart of being an active listener, is asking questions, engaging with the others, and find out more about what they care about and what they want. If what you want to do is monologue about what you’ve learned, <a href="https://medium.com/m/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F">Start a blog!</a></p>

<p>But conversing with your friends and family should be about learning about your friends and family, and building and maintaining those bonds. And if you find that you are the only one asking questions, maybe talk about with them and let them know how you feel. I think everyone could do with being more empathetic.</p>

<p>I for one am challenging myself to ask at least one genuine question when every I speak with someone.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have seen this lack of listening in yourself or others. What do you do when you notice it? Has anyone ever pointed it out to you?</p>

<p>If they have, I recommend taking the same challenge, and start asking more questions.</p>
