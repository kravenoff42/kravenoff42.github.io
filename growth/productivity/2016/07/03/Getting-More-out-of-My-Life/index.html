  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Yesterday, was the First time in a long time that I felt like I really go the most out of my day. I cleaned three fairly small, but important areas of my house, I started work on my new personal website, I helped my wife get her work done by watching our daughter, wrote an article for medium –and– spend the evening with my wife and friends, just having fun… guilt free fun. And for the first time ever, I think, it was on purpose.</p>

<p>Productivity has always been some that I have struggled with. For a long time I told myself that I was just better at working under pressure. And then after college, I owned up to the fact that I was just a procrastinator. But like most of us that did not stop the procrastination. What it took, for me, was a blow up argument with my wife about how I didn’t keep the house like she wanted me to. And a new app.</p>

<p>I was insistent that I could not clean the house like she wanted, “I’m not you, I need you help”. This sounded very reasonable to both of us. And she reluctantly agreed to start a running list of tasks that I would do everyday, for two weeks. “If is really not working after that, we’ll figure something else out”.</p>

<p>After 4 days, things started to fall apart. She would forget to add to the list and I wouldn’t remind her. She would be preoccupied and unable to think of something, it did take 2 weeks to see it was not going to work. Luckily, the things my wife had brought up in the argument had stuck with me, I was unfocused, lazy, easily distracted, and a clean house was not motivation enough to drive me. This was how I lived, but I had to admit, it was not working. So, I began a hunt for an app that I could program to run my life. Something I could set the parameters for and only think about when I needed to.</p>

<p>I downloaded maybe a dozen to-do apps and habit apps, and started quickly eliminating candidates, the app needed to be highly customizable. I even considered trying to program my own. But then I tried [Fabulous][http://www.thefabulous.co/], and I almost dismissed it out of hand for not immediately allowing my to set a task. But then it asked me something I hadn’t thought about. “What you want?”… it honestly stopped me in my tracks, I scrolled through the four options and saw “Focus and Concentrate more”. That I thought, would be helpful, if not for my housekeeping then certainly for my studies.</p>

<p>But then the app had me read a letter. It explained the importance of keeping a to-do list, and not in an app, but in a notebook, written out. It said, write the list everyday, and that will start you on your way. It has been two weeks and I have written in it everyday, and with each milestone they have sent me another letter explaining another good habit and, crucially for me, they explain how it is going to help and why it’s important. And now as I said I am getting more done.</p>

<p>I don’t always finish the list, but when something goes undone I know and can adjust appropriately. Now I am keeping the house better than my wife used to, writing more code, and writing more in general, I am also exercising more, and staying more on top of my job search.</p>

<p>I would not say that it is due entirely to the app, I have been doing a lot of soul searching lately, and that has helped. I have also, in that search, found a lot of great resources, which I am sure I will talk about in the future. But the change did start with that question. “What do you want?” To be healthier, to be more productive, to have more energy, to be a better friend, to be a better parent? Start by answering the question and then write it down. Define the problem so you can understand it, start a to do list and put items on it that move you toward that goal.</p>

<p>It sounds too easy, but it’s not. It’s hard, there is no rule that says you have to be better. Most employers will tolerate sub-par performance, because everyone does it. No one will make you become the person you want to be, because that all want you to be someone else. But making change is not about large life altering events. It’s about small incremental steps. Write down those steps and start crossing them off. You can do it, I know because I am doing it. I am not special, or experienced, or especially motivated by nature. I just answered a question, and started a list.</p>

<p>So, what do you want?</p>
