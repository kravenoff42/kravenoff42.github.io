    <p>It can be hard to know that you are on the right path. Will learning all this CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc. help me find a job I love? I hope so, but if I am honest with myself, there is a part of me that really doubts it. That part of me is convinced that I need to go back to working part time at the library and resign myself to poverty, and wait for the National Basic Income to come into being.</p>

<p>But I choose to ignore that voice, that guys is a lazy jerk, and he wants me to be one too. I have chosen this path carefully, I did my research, and I consulted with experts, friends and family. I don’t trust in my intuition, I trust in my decision. I have set a course and now I will follow it. I know I have the ability, and I think I have the talent, all I need to provide now is the commitment.</p>

<p>Their are a lot of ways to sabotage yourself, but none are easier then second guessing a decision to learn. There are many paths in life that need to be questioned and requestioned, but learning a new skill set will always benefit you in the end no matter the outcome. Being scared is natural but there is only one way to master your life, make the decision to learn. And don’t stop learning. Read and watch, and listen, and discover, everything you can about your thing. Make it apart of your identity, make it so that you wouldn’t know what to do if you couldn’t do this thing anymore.</p>

<p>Doing this won’t make you happy, I need to be clear on this. If you have food, shelter, your health, and loved ones, and you are still unhappy, you need to talk about it, if not with professional, than with someone. Money, and success will not change your perception of the world, it will amplify it.</p>

<p>But if you have a positive outlook on life, skill will make you valuable, and hard-work will make you productive. Even if you don’t end up wealth beyond reason, how could you not take pride in that. If you can produce work of value than you will be appreciated, by someone if not everyone.</p>

<p>You can’t know that you are doing the <strong>right</strong> thing, but I think you can know that you can know that you are doing a <strong>worthwhile</strong> thing. And maybe thats all you need.</p>
