    <p>One thing that is extremely important when you are trying to put yourself and your talents out into the world, is to know and be confident in who you are. This is easier said than done and many of us well know. But if you don’t know who you are how can you effectively communicate what is special or valuable about yourself to others?</p>

<p>Today I was writing up a new resume, and on the advice of several career counselors I am adding a personality statement. I used to have a mission statement, but if you are applying to a position, your mission is clear (get a job). Instead, what I want to add is a statement that show the recruiter or employer a quick and clear insight into who I am, what I can bring to their organization, and an indication of how I will fit with my potential coworkers.</p>

<p>This is a tall order. In just one or two sentences I need to tell the person reading my resume that I am friendly, and courteous. That I give my advice when I have insight, and that I always ask for help when I need it. I need them to know that I can learn on the job, and that I will invest the same amount of effort in them that they will in me.</p>

<p>Now, in the past you could count on your cover letter to do this for you, but with resume getting aggregated and concentrated with modern job portals. Employers now have hundreds (not dozens) of resumes to get through and most, not all, but most cover letters end up collecting virtual dust. So, the point is to make the most of those first few lines, because that is all you will likely get.</p>

<p>So, what do I want to be to them in those few words? I am confident, without saying that I am. I am talented, but driven to learn. I am friendly, and kind, and generous with my efforts. I want them to know that I am a relentless optimist and always approach new challenges with a positive attitude. I may be old for someone just starting in this industry, but that only makes me more driven to catch up to my peers. It also mean that I bring a different perspective to my work and in turn their team. And finally I want to leave them with the impression that I will not only meet their requirements, but that I will exceed their expectations.</p>

<p>Well, that is quite a lot… but lets work through this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My drive to learn has taken me down many avenues, <em>and</em> in <del>everything that I have been challenged with</del><em>every challenge that I<del>‘ve</del> face<del>d~~_ I always bring a positive attitude, a kind spirit, and an open mind. Having only recently found my true calling, I am eager to make up for lost time, and to find a ~~place where I can call home.</del> _community of peers to grow with.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so here is the new version.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My drive to learn has taken me down many avenues, and in every challenge that I face I always bring a positive attitude, a kind spirit, and an open mind. Having only recently found my true calling, I am eager to make up for lost time, and to find a community of peers to grow with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, I honestly didn’t think I would get it that quick, I <em>was</em> hoping that talking my way through the purpose of the statement would clarify message, but it was surprisingly effective.</p>

<p>In fact, if there is a message you take from this entry, it’s this: Write it down.</p>

<p>Whatever it is you are trying to wrap your head around, and in what ever form is comfortable. Write it down. Even if it only bullet points on a napkin, write it down. And keep writing until the subject is clear to you.</p>
