    <p>Today, I  am answering the challenge that was put forward by <a href="http://travisneilson.com/">Travis Neilson</a> on the <a href="http://www.travandlos.com/">Late Nights with Trav and Los</a> podcast, to write 200 words in the next three days. I have been meaning to start a blog for some time now, to document my education in software engineering, so I am seizing this moment to start.</p>

<p>For the last seven months I have been engaged in a quest to learn everything I can about software engineering, web development and computer science. I started by enrolling at a local tech Institute called New England Tech, and have been working through every tutorial and project I can find.</p>

<p>I have also, through an unrelated set of events I also lost my job, so I have also been trying to find work, preferably in the same field. And to top everything off just Seven and a half months ago my wife and I had our first child…</p>

<p>Taken all together, it makes this year a year of starting over, and I have I think done my best to embrace the opportunity that such a crucible can be.</p>

<p>So, seeing as this the first in a long series of posts documenting my progress. Let me take this first to record where I am currently for contrast.</p>

<p>I am 30 years old, married, with a new baby. I graduated from high school in 2004 – where I discovered a love for web design and ceramics, and from Rhode Island College in 2009. I studied Fine Arts Sculpture with a focus on ceramics. I never followed up with Web design in college, mostly because I didn’t know enough to realize that web design is just a facet of graphic design which I could have majored in. But you live and learn. And after graduating that is exactly what I did. I taught myself photoshop, illustrator, inDesign, I learned the Silk-screen printing process and started entering in contests. In 2014, I landed an entry level design position at an up and coming tech company.</p>

<p>Let me take a moment to express how amazing this position and company were. They were young and enthusiastic and passionate about both the company and the work we were doing. These things may not seem particularly unique, especially in the tech industry, but it was the first time I had ever experienced such a working environment. It was also, as it turned out, a turning point. After nine months of working there, the company decided that Rhode Island was not the best place for their headquarters and laid off just about everyone working in the Providence office. Including me.</p>

<p>With a pregnant wife and bills to pay, it was scramble time I spent the last 2 months there, looking for anywhere else that might take me. I wound up at a small novelty design company. Which was the polar opposite of the last job. The product was useless, and often uninspiring, the people were overworked and turnover was high. It became clear after the first few months that, while I had learned a ton about design and manufacturing, that I needed to get out of there.</p>

<p>So I made a decision. I would go back to school, this time for software engineering, and I would get into a career where I might be head hunted, and where my skills would be valued. After enrolling, I sent my resume out to everyone I could find, and in April of this year found a position at Hasbro Inc.</p>

<p>This had seriously been a fantasy of mine for years, but now it was time to prove myself, get my foot in the door and make something of myself… three days later they terminated my contract without so much as a good-bye.</p>

<p>Now I am unemployed, but working hard to develope my new skill set, while trying to change the way I run my life and keep my daughter safe and cared for. It is a crazy and stressful time, but I am hopeful that I will come through it stronger and faster than I was.</p>
