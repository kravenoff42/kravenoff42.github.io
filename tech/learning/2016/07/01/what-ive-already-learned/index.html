    <p>Yesterday, I outlined my current situation, but I skimmed over my actual software studies. I’m going to take one more post and lay out what I have learned so far.</p>

<p>In high school I took a summer course that taught me what HTML was and the basics of how to use it and then of the next few years I taught myself CSS and Javascript, well sort of. The farthest I got was js alerts.</p>

<p>From then until 6 months ago I basically abandoned coding and web design for other pursuits.</p>

<p>Since January of this year I have quainted myself with HTML, and filled in HTML5, and did the same with CSS and CSS3. I taught myself the basics of C++, and C#, which I am getting ready to take a class on. I have also found basically every JavaScript Tutorial I can get my hands on, and have learned a lot about jQuery, and DOM scripting.</p>

<p>I also took a course in SQL which was fascinating, if a bit easy. And next up on my list of languages is PHP, so that I can get my JavaScript talking to MySQL. (I actually bought a Raspberry Pi and set it up as an apache server, running MySQL). So far, most of my interest lays in the web and front end development, but I suspect that is mostly because that is my comfort zone.</p>

<p>I have also been learning a lot about GitHub and the ins and outs of open source. Which I hope to turn into a major source of my extracurricular studies. Right now, my biggest source of practice and information is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>. I am about ⅓ the way through their material and loving courses.</p>

<p>I have also started working on Ruby, which feels so good to work with, and can’t wait to put something real together with it. So far, it has only been tutorials and small challenges. This, by the way, is how I have mostly been learning these various technologies and languages.</p>

<p>I have, however, put together several small projects from the Free Code Camp course map, which many reading this will likely be familiar with. I have completed and refactored, the WikiPedia search API, the Quote generator, the weather display. I have also worked on a small list maker app, right now it can’t store the list, but I am hoping to add this function soon.</p>

<p>All of these projects can be found on my portfolio site, which is currently displayed in markdown format on GitHub, but I am currently refactoring the portfolio to be a stand alone <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll site</a>. As far as I can tell Jekyll is perfect for these kind of static sites that primarily act as an archive of writing and images. I have just started this process so I hope to document the process here.</p>

<p>So, like I said this should be the last list of things I am doing. For future post I hope to make these more casual and dealing directly with what I am learning.</p>
