>My drive to learn has taken me down many avenues. In every challenge that I face I always bring a positive perspective, a kind attitude, and an open mind. I always strive to master the tools I use and endeavor to help my peers do the same. Now I want to find a home; a place that needs my talents where I can make a difference.
